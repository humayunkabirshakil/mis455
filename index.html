        <h2>About VOLVO</h2>
        <p>
            The Volvo Group (Swedish: Volvokoncernen; legally Aktiebolaget Volvo, shortened to AB Volvo, stylized as
            VOLVO) is a Swedish multinational manufacturing corporation headquartered in Gothenburg. While its core
            activity is the production, distribution and sale of trucks, buses and construction equipment, Volvo also
            supplies marine and industrial drive systems and financial services. In 2016, it was the world's
            second-largest manufacturer of heavy-duty trucks.

            Automobile manufacturer Volvo Cars, also based in Gothenburg, was part of AB Volvo until 1999, when it was
            sold to the Ford Motor Company. Since 2010 Volvo Cars has been owned by the automotive company Geely Holding
            Group. Both AB Volvo and Volvo Cars share the Volvo logo and cooperate in running the Volvo Museum in
            Sweden.

            The corporation was first listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange in 1935, and was on the NASDAQ indices from
            1985 to 2007.

            Volvo was established in 1915 as a subsidiary of SKF, a ball bearing manufacturer; however both the Volvo
            Group and Volvo Cars regard the rollout of the company's first car series, the Volvo Ã–V, on 14 April 1927,
            as their beginning.
